#The convolutional layer C1 filter three 512 x 384 input images with 32 kernels of size 7 x 7 with a stride of 1 pixel. The stride of pooling layer S1 is 2 pixels. Then, the convolved images of LH and HL are merged together by taking the maximum from both the images. In the next step, the convolved image of LL is merged with the Max result by multiplying both the results (as explained in section III-B). C2-C4 has 16 kernels of size 3 x 3 with a stride of 1 pixel. S2 pools the merged features with a stride of 4. The dropout is applied to the output of S4 which has been flattened. The fully connected layer FC1 has 32 neurons and FC2 has 1 neuron. The activation of the output layer is a softmax function.

#One significant observation found while analyzing the images is, when the image intensities are relatively darker, the patterns aren’t visible much. The darker regions in the image produce less Moire ́ patterns compared to the brighter regions in the image. To summarize the spread of the Moire ́ pattern in the image, spatially, and to produce this effect while training the network, we used the LL band of the image (which is the downsampled original image consisting of low frequency information) and used it as weights for LH anf HL band during the training, by directly multiplying it to the convolved and combined response of the LH and HL bands
